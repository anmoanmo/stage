Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

我能否将你比作夏天？ 

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

你比夏天更美丽温婉。

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

狂风将五月的蓓蕾凋残，

And summer's lease hath all too short a date:

夏日的勾留何其短暂。

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

休恋那丽日当空，

And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;

转眼会云雾迷蒙。

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

休叹那百花飘零，

By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd

催折于无常的天命。

But thy eternal summer shall not fade

唯有你永恒的夏日常新，

Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;

你的美貌亦毫发无损。 

Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,

死神也无缘将你幽禁，

When in eternal lines to time thou growest:

你在我永恒的诗中长存。

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,

只要世间尚有人吟诵我的诗篇，

So long lives this and this gives life to thee.

这诗就将不朽，永葆你的芳颜。
